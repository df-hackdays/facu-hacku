# Problem

Students in the classroom often fail to seek advice because they don't want to be disruptive, they feel intimidated or embarrassed by asking "dumb" questions in front of others

# Opportunity

How do we empower students to seek help when needed?

# Empowerment

We hope to empower students by:

- getting them to seek customized help based on skill level, how and when they want
- provide them with hints to allow them to solve the problem on their own
- provide positive feedback and minimize feelings of incompetence
